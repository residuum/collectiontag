**Due to Github's determination to be the "worldâ€™s leading AI-powered developer platform" I will move my projects to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Residuum)**

Python script for tagging your music collection with genres and keywords from [discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) and [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)

# Pre-requisites
Python 3 with the following packages:

- pytaglib
- python3-discogs-client
- pyquery
- lxml
- urllib3

Install via

    pip3 install pytablib python3-discogs-client pyquery lxml urllib3

# Configuration
- `GENRE_SEPARATOR`: separator string between different tags. Genres from discogs contain `,` and 
may contain whitespace, so these characters should not be used.
- `DISCOGS_TOKEN`: Getting data from discogs requires a token, which in turn requires a discogs account. 
Using [discogs developer settings](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) you can generate a new token.
- `MUSIC_FOLDER`: Path to your music folder

# Running the script
    python3 collectiontag.py

# Assumptions in the Script
- Artist, album names and album artists are correctly tagged.
- Compilations with multiple artists have album artists set to `Various` or `Various Artists`
- Downloads from Bandcamp still contain the original comment: `Visit https://<profile>.bandcamp.com`
